Through the endless daydream
AEC            cD#D       
I saw you on the way back
 GDF#             ebd
There I walked with you in my arms
A E               DACD#
Through the blurry darkness
Who¡¯s veiling on the twilight
We¡¯ve been far away from my fears
Somewhere else I¡¯ll see you
Our days be like a blossom
Blooming all around you, so bright
By and by, I¡¯ll miss you
and your laugh like a sunshine
Fading into shadow of tears
All around me is your light
With you, everything so shines
How come we¡¯ll leave all behind
Cause your love is falling on my heart
And I¡¯m falling for you
Falling with broken wings again
Hush now, my angel, I will always be withyou
In your pretty smile, in a glow of tears
Out across the frosty night
I¡¯ll be there with you
Maybe someday you¡¯ll wake up alone withoutme
But don¡¯t cry again, I¡¯ll be waiting here
Where the moon is on the rise
As the olden days
I could just go with you¡­between ourtime
Where they can¡¯t find us¡­ somehow
You could just come away ¡­ with me,out there
Where we could dream away¡­ All day
Hush now, my angel, I will always be withyou
In your pretty smile, in a glow of tears
Out across the frosty night
I¡¯ll be there with you
Maybe you¡¯ll always breath in me, ever inmy heart
All the little pieces of you, look how theyshine above
Come away with me tonight
We¡¯ll be dreaming away there
Maybe you¡¯ll always breath in me, ever inmy heart
All the little pieces of you,look how theyshine above
Come away with me tonight
We¡¯ll be dreaming away there
Always¡­¡­
